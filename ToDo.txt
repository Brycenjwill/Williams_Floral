@UI//View
(A) Create an event dispay container @Due(Sat-Mar-16)
    -How-
      -Possibly have a scrollable div with a max width and height smaller than
       page width and height

(B) Research modern date display UI @Due(Sat-Mar-16)
    -How-
        -Maybe copy from Googles ui design for day view???

(B) Implement modern date display UI that shows events @Due(Sat-Mar-16)--Flex


@Backend
(A) Decide how to store event data once retrieved @Due(Sat-Mar-16)
    -How-
        -Using the Event Object-
        - Maybe create an event object for each event to display, storing the time
            in the object, as well as the length (If needed for 30, 15, 60 min blocks?)

        -Using a list of tuples?- 
        - If only shooting for a v basic functionality, store tuple of time and len of event?


(B) Refactor READ OP code using Promises @Due(PRE-LAUNCHJ)
    -How-
        -Rewrite getDb functions to no longer use recursion // .then statements, 
        to use promises instead
